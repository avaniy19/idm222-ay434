              <div class="slides__item slide-2" id="slide-2"> <p>The website I selected to analyze and redesign was britneyspears.com. This website was made for fans of 90’s pop-princess Britney Spears. The site was created in October of 1999 and has gone through multiple phases and changes to match the tone of her image/persona and the music that she was releasing. Some of the site’s goals are to keep fans informed and updated, showcase her awards and accomplishments, allow fans to get a more personal look of Britney Spears on her other social media platforms, and connect fans to the store to buy merchandise. </p> </div>              
              <div class="slides__item slide-3" id="slide-3"> <p>The overall changes I made to britneyspears.com create a sense of unity and ease of use. Before, on the original site, there was no unity of elements and no cohesion, making it very difficult to navigate around the site. They had originally employed a very minimal, scarce design but it was very difficult for users to find what information they were looking for. By implementing a navigation bar, displaying information on the homepage, and reorganizing the contents of the menu, the website now more clear-cut and uncomplicated. And with aesthetic choices such as my fonts and color scheme, the tone of Britney Spear’s career and legacy was able to be conveyed: classic and mature, but always with an element of surprise, and staying true to herself.  </p> </div>

They define themselves as a “stylish, fashion-savvy design publication for the consumer who reads everything but knows what she wants”. I was took on the position of UI/UX redesign and improving the mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces of the site.
                <br> I conducted research and analysis to address the problems that existed on ELLE Decor’s website. I developed a User Persona to help me visualize my findings. With the use of card sorts and surveys, I developed more simple and straightforward menus for the site.   </p> </div>

                From this project I learned a lot of important techniques and skills regarding UX Research. The main points of knowledge I will bring with me to my future projects are the importance of conducting research prior to starting design, developing User Personas to guide design and aesthetic decisions, create wireframes with mobile-first design in mind. </p>
